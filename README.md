# BiophysicalEcology
This is just a repository of some common functions I use to make calculations of mass and heat transfer in organisms.  It's similar to NicheMapR except I'm trash with R and needed a python version for my calculations.  Most information is derived from Gates 1980 "Biophysical Ecology"



Welcome, this is a repository where I am just programming some simple physics equations related
to my biophysical ecology research for later use, packages are named after the chapter in Gates 1980 from which the 
Equations are taken, I'll add more documentation later
